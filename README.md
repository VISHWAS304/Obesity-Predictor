## Overview

**Obesity Predictor** is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts future obesity levels based on user lifestyle inputs. Built with Python, Streamlit, and AWS, this repository serves as both a research project and a study resource in Machine Learning and Generative AI.

*Note: While this project uses a selected set of tools and processes to deliver its functionality, additional industry-standard tools and MLOps processes are not implemented in the current version but are considered for future enhancements.*

## Features

- **Machine Learning-Powered Predictions:**  
  Uses various ML algorithms to forecast obesity levels based on input data.

- **Interactive Web Application:**  
  A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for real-time user interaction.

- **Cloud-Integrated Data Handling:**  
  Leverages AWS services (S3, Glue, RDS, ECR, EC2) for storage, ETL, and deployment.

- **Containerized Deployment:**  
  Docker is used for building and deploying the application, ensuring consistency across environments.

- **SQL & Generative AI Integration:**  
  Implements SQL along with LLMs for natural language interaction with the database.
